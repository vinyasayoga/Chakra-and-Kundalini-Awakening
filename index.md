<h2>Kundalini Awakening</h2>

<p>Along the base of the spinal cord, there lies a powerful source of energy in the human body.  It is in a coiled shape like a serpent sleeping in the dormant state. They connect themselves with eight different chakras (the energy centers). Each chakra in the human body corresponds to various elements of nature with mantra and color. They are –</p>

<li>
<ul>Sahasrara – crown center</ul>
<ul>Bindu – moon center</ul>
<ul>Agya – Eyebrow center</ul>
<ul>Visuddhi – throat center</ul>
<ul>Anahata – heart center</ul>
<ul>Manipura – navel center</ul>
<ul>Swadhisthana – lower abdominal center</ul>
<ul>Muladhara – root center</ul>
</li>

<p>These chakras remain in their dormant state until they awaken with mantra chanting and meditation.</p> 

<p>At the base of the spin, the Muladhara connects the body and spirit in an agreement of its existence. Second is Swadhisthana, which controls the obsession with sex and helps in condemnation of fear and frigidity in life. Third, Manipura, which, when awakened fully, the chakras function correctly, the body will be healthy and long-lived. Fourth is Anahata, the heart chakra, which stands for growth of compassion, empathy, and love for the pain of others. Fifth is Vishuddhi, which allows you to understand and accept both the dark and light phases of life. The chakra is emphasized in yoga through nada and Shabd yoga, and opened through mantras, music, and chanting.</p> 

<p>When the energy from the kundalini flows through these eight chakras in the upward direction, it leads to the expansion of awareness. This is known as Kundalini Awakening.</p>
